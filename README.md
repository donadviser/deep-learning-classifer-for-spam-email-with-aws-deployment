# Deep Learning for Spam Email Classification Deployed on AWS

This project implements a Neural Network Classifier for Spam Classification, achieving great accuracy (~97%) and deployed on AWS. It covers the complete lifecycle of an ML project from data collection to deployment.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building and deploying a machine learning model for spam email classification using a Neural Network. Key phases of the project include:

- **Data Collection:** Utilized a dataset of spam and non-spam emails for training the classifier.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the dataset for model training.
- **Model Training:** Developed a Neural Network model using TensorFlow/Keras to classify emails.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Model Deployment:** Deployed the trained model on AWS using Streamlit for interactive web application deployment.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to demonstrate the end-to-end process of deploying a machine learning model, emphasizing the importance of deployment skills for aspiring Data Scientists and ML engineers.

## Workflows

The workflow begins with creating a virtual environment, `template.py`, `setup.py`, and `requirements.txt` to establish the file and directory structure and create a package. The remainder of the workflow follows a loop of the steps below:

1. Update `config.yaml`
2. Update `secrets.yaml` [Optional]
3. Update `params.yaml`
4. Update the entity
5. Update the configuration manager in `src/config`
6. Update the components
7. Update the pipeline
8. Update `main.py`
9. Update `dvc.yaml`


## Tech Stacks
 - **Python:** Programming language used for data preprocessing, model training, and deployment.
 - **TensorFlow/Keras:** Deep learning framework used to build and train the Neural Network model.
 - **Streamlit:** Used for building and deploying the web application for model inference.
 - **AWS (Amazon Web Services):** Cloud platform used for model deployment.
 - **Joblib:** Library used for saving and loading models.
 - **Scikit-learn:** Used for various machine learning utilities including metrics calculation and data preprocessing.
 - **NLTK and WordCloud:** Used for natural language processing and visualization tasks.



# How to Deploy Streamlit app on EC2 instance

## 1. Login with your AWS console and launch an EC2 instance

## 2. Run the following commands

### Note: Do the port mapping to this port:- 8501

```bash
sudo apt update
```

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

```bash
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

```bash
sudo apt install git curl unzip tar make sudo vim wget -y
```

```bash
sudo apt install git curl unzip tar make sudo vim wget -y
```

```bash
git clone "Your-repository"
cd "Your-repository"
```

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
#Temporary running
python3 -m streamlit run app.py
```

```bash
#Permanent running
nohup python3 -m streamlit run app.py
```

Note: Streamlit runs on this port: 8501
